Module to drive the 32 bit CCD clock sequencer through the parallel printer port.

	" sequencer" loadmod	# loads the sequencer interface

Open interface and initialize sequencer:

	reset>seq yields nothing

Send a byte to the sequencer:

	n 8>seq yields nothing

Check interface status. This is needed because 8>seq into a busy interface sometimes hangs forever. Sets the flag to true if the interface is busy, false otherwise:

	seqbusy? yields nothing

Higher level words are defined elsewhere: as of this writing, look in SmallPixelClocks.lse.
