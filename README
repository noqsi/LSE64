1. To Install on a *nix System

   You will need autotools installed to generate the compilation machinery.  You can make and install LSE with the following sequence of commands:

   > ./autogen.sh
   > ./configure
   > make

You can run LSE without installing it globally by typing
    > cd src
    > ./t64

You can install it globally using the usual command
    > sudo make install

2. To Install on the Armadeus

   To install on the Armadeus, you will need autotools as well as a cross compiler.  You can install a cross compiler by cloning the armadeus git repository, using the following command (you will need git installed):

   > git clone git://armadeus.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/armadeus/armadeus armadeus

   You will want to read the following website for installation instructions: http://www.armadeus.com/wiki/index.php?title=Toolchain

   Assuming you've built the armadeus tool chain, you can now cross compile.  Let:
   To cross compile, use the following commands

   > ./autogen.sh
   > export CC=<path_to_armadeus_git_repo>/armadeus/buildroot/build_armvXX/staging_dir/usr/bin/arm-linux-gcc
   > ./configure --prefix=<path_to_armadeus_git_repo>/buildroot/build_armvXX/staging_dir/usr/bin/ --host=arm-linux --target=arm-linux
   > make

   XX should be the model of your Armadeus board (on my system XX=5te).

   To install, you will need to have kermit and tftp set up.  See this website for instructions on how to do this: http://armadeus.com/wiki/index.php?title=Communicate

   Issue the following commands:

   > cd src
   > cp t64 boot.lse <path_to_tftp>
   > sudo ifconfig <ethernet_device> 192.168.0.3
   > kermit -c
   ...log in to linux on the armadeus if necessary...
   # tftp -g -r t64 192.168.0.3
   # tftp -g -r boot.lse 192.168.0.3
   # chmod +x t64
   ... quit out of kermit with "ctrl-\ Q"

   Where: 
          • <path_to_tftp> is the path to your local tftp directory (on my system this is /srv/tftp).
          • <ethernet_device> is the ethernet device you are talking to the armadeus with (on my system, this is eth1).  If you don't have a device devoted to this, and you have your armadeus connected to your local area network, can skip the ifconfig command provided that you use your IP rather than 192.168.0.3
